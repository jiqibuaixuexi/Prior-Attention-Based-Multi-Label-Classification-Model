### Key Highlights:
1. **Unified Multi-Label Classification Model**: We propose the first integrated multi-label classification model for diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis and assessing sacroiliac and hip joint lesions from pelvic X-ray images.
2. **Prior Attention Mechanism**: The model introduces a prior attention mechanism that significantly improves performance and reliability by accurately identifying key regions, such as the sacroiliac and hip joints, in pelvic X-ray images.
3. **Superior Generalization Capability**: The model’s generalization ability is validated through multi-center external test sets, demonstrating robust and consistent performance across diverse datasets and environments.
4. **Label-wise and Region-wise Interpretability Analysis**: An analysis is conducted to interpret the model’s behavior on a per-label and per-region basis.

### Purpose of This Repository:
This repository serves as an open resource for researchers and practitioners interested in:
- Reproducing the results of this study.
- Extending the proposed methods to other classification tasks in medical imaging.
- Exploring model interpretability techniques for clinical applications.
